Nothing amazing here, I just wanted to write out a ReadMe.
## Instructions
Use the [main.cpp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qBlE2-WL60) file to run the program, then input the zip code you would like to find.
```c++
std::cout << "Don't worry about the program, it works perfectly" << endl;
std::string UselessFeedback;
cin >> UselessFeedback;
```
## Contributing
Michael is writing this ReadMe. Don't trust anything, as this is his first ever ReadMe. Manny is the contributor on the file. I will reccomend that he makes a Git as well, and I will help contribute on his.
